What is XML?
    XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language
    XML is a markup language much like HTML
    XML was designed to store and transport data
    XML was designed to be self-descriptive

XML Does Not DO Anything
Example:
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>

The XML above is self-descriptive:
    It has sender information
    It has receiver information
    It has a heading
    It has a message body
    But still, the XML above does not DO anything. XML is just information wrapped in tags.

Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive, store, or display it.

The Difference Between XML and HTML
XML and HTML were designed with different goals:
    XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
    HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
    XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are
    
    
What is JSON?
    JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
    JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
    JSON is used to send data between computers
    JSON is language independent 
Ex: '{"name":"John", "age":30, "car":null}'
    It defines an object with 3 properties:
    name
    age
    car
    Each property has a value.
    
Why Use JSON?
    The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects. 
    Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.
    Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language.
    JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects:
        JSON.parse()
    JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string:
        JSON.stringify()
